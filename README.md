Thanks to native JSON support, creating a REST API with Azure SQL and .NET Core is really a matter of a few lines of code:

```csharp
    var qr = await conn.ExecuteScalarAsync<string>(
        sql: procedure,
        param: parameters,
        commandType: CommandType.StoredProcedure
    );
    
    var result = JsonDocument.Parse(qr);
```

This is possible thanks to [Azure SQL native support to JSON](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/sql-database/sql-database-json-features) format and the MicroORM [Dapper](https://medium.com/dapper-net/get-started-with-dapper-net-591592c335aa) that removes all the plumbing code and returns not tables and columns but a fully deserialized object. Object that can be a POCO object or just JSON for maximum flexibilty.

## Install Sample Database

In order to run this sample, the WideWorldImporters database is needed. Install WideWorldImporters sample database:

[Restore WideWorldImporters Database](https://github.com/yorek/azure-sql-db-samples#restore-wideworldimporters-database)

## Add Database Objects

Once the sample database has been installed, you need to add some stored procedures that will be called from .NET. The SQL code is available here:

`./SQL/WideWorldImportersUpdates.sql`

If you need any help in executing the SQL script, you can find a Quickstart here: [Quickstart: Use Azure Data Studio to connect and query Azure SQL database](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sql/azure-data-studio/quickstart-sql-database)

## Run sample locally

Make sure you have [.NET Core 6.0](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download) SDK installed on your machine. Clone this repo in a directory on your computer and then configure the connection string in `appsettings.json`.

If you don't want to save the connection string in the `appsettings.json` file for security reasons, you can just set it using an environment variable:

Linux:

```bash
export ConnectionStrings__DefaultConnection="<your-connection-string>"
```

Windows (Powershell):

```powershell
$Env:ConnectionStrings__DefaultConnection="<your-connection-string>"
```

Your connection string is something like:

```text
SERVER=<your-server-name>.database.windows.net;DATABASE=<your-database-name>;UID=DotNetWebApp;PWD=a987REALLY#$%TRONGpa44w0rd!
```

Just replace `<your-server-name>` and `<your-database-name>` with the correct values for your environment.

To run and test the REST API locally, just run

```bash
dotnet run
```

.NET will start the HTTP server and when everything is up and running you'll see something like

```text
Now listening on: https://localhost:5001
```

Using a REST Client (like [Insomnia](https://insomnia.rest/), [Postman](https://www.getpostman.com/) or curl), you can now call your API, for example:

```bash
curl -k -X GET https://localhost:5001/customer/123
```

and you'll get info on Customer 123:

```json
[
    {
        "CustomerID": 123,
        "CustomerName": "Tailspin Toys (Roe Park, NY)",
        "PhoneNumber": "(212) 555-0100",
        "FaxNumber": "(212) 555-0101",
        "WebsiteURL": "http://www.tailspintoys.com/RoePark",
        "Delivery": {
            "AddressLine1": "Shop 219",
            "AddressLine2": "528 Persson Road",
            "PostalCode": "90775"
        }
    }
]
```

## Deploy to Azure

Now that your REST API solution is ready, it's time to deploy it on Azure so that anyone can take advantage of it. A detailed article on how you can that that is here:

- [Create an ASP.NET Core app in App Service on Linux](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/app-service/containers/quickstart-dotnetcore)

The only thing you have do in addition to what explained in the above article is to add the connection string to the Azure Web App configuration. Using AZ CLI, for example:

```bash
appName="azure-sql-db-dotnet-rest-api"
resourceGroup="my-resource-group"

az webapp config connection-string set \
    -g $resourceGroup \
    -n $appName \
    --settings DefaultConnection=$ConnectionStrings__DefaultConnection \
    --connection-string-type=SQLAzure
```

Just make sure you correctly set `$appName` and `$resourceGroup` to match your environment and also that the variable `$ConnectionStrings__DefaultConnection` as also been set, as mentioned in section "Run sample locally". 

An example of a full script that deploys the REST API is available here: `azure-deploy.sh`.
